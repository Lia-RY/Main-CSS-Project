        <h2>Shakh Plov</h2>
        <p>Azerbaijani Crown Rice Pilaf</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul class="ingredient-list">
            <li>4 eggplants</li>
            <li>4 tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tbs olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>3 green pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of the clarified butter in a large frying pan and cook the chicken thighs, in batches,
                over a medium-high heat until golden all over but not necessarily cooked through. Set the chicken aside,
                but don't worry about cleaning the pan, as you will be cooking the shallots in it.</li>
            <li>Place the saffron in 2 ounces|50 ml cold water in a bowl and leave to stand on a warm surface – they are
                cautious with saffron in Azerbaijan, believing that soaking it in hot water kills its flavour.</li>
            <li>Melt a few more tablespoons of the clarified butter in the frying pan and cook the shallots until soft
                and lightly caramelized.</li>
            <li>Shred the chicken, then add it to the caramelized shallots with the saffron and its soaking water and
                season well with salt and pepper. Stir in the cumin, flaked almonds and dried fruit, then cover the pan
                with a lid and cook over a low heat for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave it to cool down a bit.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pan with water, add loads of salt and bring to a rolling boil. Add the rice to
                the boiling water, then wait for it to boil furiously, stirring once. Boil for 7 minutes until al dente,
                then drain it thoroughly. They use massive colanders in Azerbaijan with a surface area large enough to
                allow the rice to cool down properly, but instead you can tip the rice on to a large baking tray and
                spread it out so that the steam escapes and the rice doesn't overcook.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F), Gas Mark 4.Brush most of the lavash, one by one, with the remaining
                melted Clarified Butter – or dip into the butter in a bowl, as they do in Azerbaijan(!), then use to
                line the base and sides of the deep ovenproof pan, allowing enough overhanging the sides to cover the
                top when folded over. Build up 3 layers of the lavash with no holes showing, using your judgement as to
                how many lavash you want to dip into the butter, as you want it all to be buttery but not completely
                soaking.
            </li>
            <li>Using a large spoon, add the chicken mixture to the lavash pan and then add the rice mixture gently so
                that it's not tightly packed in. Carefully fold the overhanging lavash over the rice to encase it.
                Cover the pan with the lid and bake for 40 minutes. Then lower the oven temperature to 160°C (325°F),
                Gas Mark 3, remove the lid and bake for a further 10 minutes so that the top crisps up.
                Using a thick tea towel, very carefully (as some butter might splatter you) tip the plov onto a plate.
                You should have something that looks like a gorgeous, crispy-skinned pie. Leave it to stand for 5
                minutes before cutting it. You should hear a very satisfying crunchy sound.</li>
